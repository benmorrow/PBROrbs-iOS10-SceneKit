Requires Xcode 8, Swift 3, iOS 10, watchOS 3. Run on devices, **not** the simulator. Only devices support the Metal rendering API. 

Sadly, the Apple Watch does not currently support Metal rendering. Hopefully Apple adds the capability for physical rendering in a future version of watchOS. H/T [Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38889264/watchos-3-support-for-scnlightingmodelphysicallybased)
